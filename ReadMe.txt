-Edge Detection with Filters:
This Python script performs edge detection on a grayscale image using convolution filters.
It utilizes the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries for image processing and visualization.

-Features:
>Reads a sample image (sample.jpg) and converts it to grayscale.
>Applies various convolution filters to enhance edge features.
>Performs thresholding to create a binary edge detection result.
>Displays the original image and the edge detection result side by side.

-Thresholding:
A threshold value of 40 is applied to the edge detection result to create a binary image.

-Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
<pip install numpy matplotlib scipy>

-Sample Image:
The script uses a sample image (sample.jpg).
Replace it with your own image if desired.

-Results:
The original image and the edge detection result are displayed using Matplotlib.
